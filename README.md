# Herbert

Herbert is the server-side back-end for Petra and ProTube, which are both narrowcasting-related tools used by Study Association Proto.

## Configuration

Herbert requires a .env file with some basic environment configuration. Copy .env.example and change the variables to variables suiting your environment.

When using HTTPS, create a folder ```cert```, and place server.ca, server.cer and server.key into this folder.
