# Herbert

Herbert is the server-side back-end for Petra and ProTube, which are both narrowcasting-related tools used by Study Association Proto.

**Herbert is not yet finished! A lot of functionality is still missing, including authentication-related functionality and basic communication with his wife Petra. Herbert is not ready to be used in a production environment, and needs to grow up first.**

## Configuration

Herbert requires a .env file with some basic environment configuration.
